## A1: CheckedIn

**CheckedIn** project is an online information system created to administer and coordinate events of all kinds, allowing users to explore, search and enrol in events of their interests.

The goal of this web-based project is to encourage the gathering of the community, families and friends, by smoothing out the organizing process, while being a safe ground for tolerance, empathy and awareness. Anyone can browse the main hub for events, search one by title, tag or date, and find users through their usernames to see their public information and feed on their profile.

**CheckedIn** users are separated into two groups with different permissions: **guests** and **authenticated users**. While guests can only browse and search for events, users with authenticated status will also be able to create events and are granted access to a profile of their own, allowing them to edit and display it the way they desire. Furthermore, they can obtain tickets for events to get the attendee status for that event, gaining the ability to comment and manifest their interests in the said event through polls created by the respective event hosts. **Event hosts** have full control over the event: they can choose to make it public or private; they can cancel it; they are in charge of the management of the tickets to be sold (price, availability, limits, among other things) and invitations. On the technical side of the product, **website administrators** are responsible for the well-functioning of the project by managing event reports and taking down events/accounts that have been reported to be harmful.

The platform will provide easy navigation and an adaptive design thatâ€™ll allow users to have an enjoyable experience.
